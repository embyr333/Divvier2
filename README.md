# Divvier2

Code, and this description, in progress...

On doing CodingBat's MakeBricks problem, I wondered if I could use an approach similar to that of the (very simple) solution I made there to make a definitive (non-random, guaranteed minimal difference for unlimited collection size) alternative to my Divvier program (see http://embyrne.c1.biz/ and https://github.com/embyr333/Divvier). Unfortunately, this is not quite working out so far, though the Divvier2 programs do get an exact split for some large input collections quicker than Divvier; the latter, conversely, finds better splits for some large inputs, but may have to be run a few times to get those as its ‘over-11’ algorithm operates by random sampling.

Dependencies: just JDK 8.

Note re build tools etc.: While I plan to use Maven in the future, for tecnhnical reasons I am not in a position to do so yet, so am just uploading source code files here for the moment.
