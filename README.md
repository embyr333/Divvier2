# Divvier2

Code, and this description, in progress...

On doing CodingBat's MakeBricks problem, I realised the following might work for a definitive (non-random, guarenteed minimal difference for unlimited collection size) of my Divvier program (see http://embyrne.c1.biz/, though the original would still have some notional utility in that it could generate alternative, more 'random' divisions, some of which might also give exact minimal difference)

Basic division capability in place...next will align output information and wording with the equivalent files from my original file and adapt it to work with the GUI for that for input and output

Dependencies: just JDK 8.

Note re build tools etc.: While I plan to use Maven in the future, for tecnhnical reasons I am not in a position to do so yet, so am just uploading source code files here for the moment.
